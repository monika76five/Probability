\begin{frame}\frametitle{Conditional probability: motivation}

The probability of getting a one when rolling a fair 6-sided die is 1/6\\
\vspace{0.5cm}\pause
Suppose you were given the extra information that the die roll was an odd number (hence 1, 3 or 5)\\
\vspace{0.5cm}\pause

\red{Conditional on this new information}, the probability of a one is now 1/3

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Conditional probability}

\begin{defn}
Given two events $A$ and $B$ with $P(B) > 0$, the \hl{conditional
probability} of $A$ given $B$ has occurred is defined as
\[P(A\mid B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}\]
\end{defn}
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item When $B$ is the sample space: $P(A \mid B) = P(A)$
\item Intuition: in a sample space with equally likely outcomes,
\[P(A \mid B) = \frac{\#(A \cap B)}{\#(B)}\]
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Example}
Consider the die roll example:  $B = \{1~\text{or}~3~\text{or}~5\}, A=\{1\}$
\begin{align*}
P(\text{get 1 given that roll is odd}) =& P(A \mid B)\\
= & \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} \\
=& \frac{P(\text{get 1})}{P(\text{get 1 or 3 or 5})} \\
=& \frac{1/6}{3/6}=\frac{1}{3}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{The Linda problem - historical results}
The Linda problem was proposed by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1983.
\begin{itemize}
\item Ranking: 1 is the most probable choice, and 8 is the least probable choice
\item Avg(Ranking of event $A$) = 2.1
\item Avg(Ranking of event $B$) = 6.2
\item Avg(Ranking of event $A \cap B$) = 4.1
\item Percentage of people ranking event $A \cap B$ higher than event $B$ = 90\% (even among those who have had several advanced courses in probability and statistics)
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Representativeness and Conjunction Bias}

\begin{itemize}
\item Representativeness heuristic:
\begin{itemize}
\item people determine the probability of an event by the degree to which the event is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population.
\item it leads people to inflate the believed probability of events that resembles the data available.
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Conjunction bias:
\begin{itemize}
\item intersecting relatively unrepresentative events (bank teller) with very representative event (feminist).
\item the description of the conjunction of the two (feminist bank teller) is considered more probable than the unrepresentative event (bank teller).
\end{itemize}
